A new email has been received and it has the words "buy" and
"win". Classify it and send it to the inbox or to the spam
folder. Here you can go through the database and count how many spam
emails contain both words "buy" and "win" and how many non-spam emails
contain both words "buy" and "win". Doing this would be correct and
you can use the exact same procedure that we used before to calculate
the probabilities. Counting the 100 emails we get these stats:

* 58 of those 100 emails are spam

* 40 of those 58 emails that are spam have the words "buy" and "win"

* 42 of those 100 emails aren't spam

* 2 of those 42 emails that aren't spam have the words "buy" and "win"

Then you can apply Bayes' rule to get:

P(spam | "buy" AND "win") = P("buy" AND "win" | spam) * P(spam) / (P("buy" AND "win" | spam) * P(spam) + P("buy" AND "win" | not spam) * P(not spam))

P(spam | "buy" AND "win") = 0.689 * 0.580 / (0.689 * 0.580 + 0.048 * 0.420) = 0.3996 / (0.3996 + 0.0202) = 0.952

This works great but things get complicated when instead of two
"features" you have a hundred or a thousand. Then you would need to
calculate the probabilities for every combination of those features
and that can be too expensive. So here cames the Naive Bayes
assumption: Each feature is independent from the other features.

With this assumption we can just estimate the probability of each
feature independently. So now counting the 100 emails we get:

* 58 of those 100 emails are spam

* 47 of those 58 emails that are spam have the word "buy"

* 41 of those 58 emails that are spam have the word "win"

* 42 of those 100 emails aren't spam

* 3 of those 42 emails that aren't spam have the word "buy"

* 5 of those 42 emails that aren't spam have the word "win"

And we can calculate the following probabilities

P("buy" AND "win" | spam) = P("buy" | spam) * P("win" | spam) =(47+1/58+2)*(41+1/58+2)=48/60 * 42/60= 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

P("buy" AND "win" | not spam) = P("buy" | not spam) * P("win" | not spam) =(3+1/42+2)*(5+1/42+2)=4/44 * 6/44= 0.09 * 0.14 = 0.0126

Then you can apply Bayes' rule to get:

P(spam | "buy" AND "win") = P("buy" AND "win" | spam) * P(spam) / (P("buy" AND "win" | spam) * P(spam) + P("buy" AND "win" | not spam) * P(not spam))

P(spam | "buy" AND "win") = 0.56 * 0.58 / (0.56 * 0.58 + 0.0126 * 0.42) = 0.984
